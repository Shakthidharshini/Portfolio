            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm  a passionate developer skilled in front-end and back-end technologies, always learning and building creative solutions. I’ve worked on real-time projects like a Smart Attendance System using Python and OpenCV and a Pet Adoption Management System during my internship at PUMO Technovation Pvt Ltd. I’ve also enhanced my front-end and back-end skills through platforms like freeCodeCamp, where I’ve built responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and implemented features like semantic HTML, form validation, and GitHub version control. I’m enthusiastic about building meaningful solutions and continuously upgrading my skill set.</p>
